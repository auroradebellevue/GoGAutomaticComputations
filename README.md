# GoGAutomaticComputations
This repository contains a collection of code to compute and verify automatic structures of groups which are fundamental graphs of groups. 
For HNN examples, the full automatic structure can theoretically be computed.
For all other graph of group examples, the word acceptor can be computed, but the multipliers cannot be computed. 

To run the code, open a terminal to the folder GoGAutomaticComputations.
Then use the command:
python3 ./conductor.py "absolute directory to group folder" "absolute directory to kbmag standalone bin folder"

The  output of the code will be put into the "current working forlder" /output. Old output will be overwritten.
