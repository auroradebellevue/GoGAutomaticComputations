#graph of groups structure example
#For i and j distinct, the entry in the ith row and jth column is the list of 
#subgroup files which have an edge from vertex i to j 
#For i=j, the entry in the ith row and ith column is the list whose first entry is 
#the rewriting system for the vertex group, then the subgroup files which have an 
#edge from vertex i to i.
