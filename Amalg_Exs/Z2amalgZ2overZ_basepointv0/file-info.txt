#graph of groups structure example
#distinguish new rows by /n and new columns by &
#For i and j distinct, the entry in the ith row and jth column is the list of 
#subgroup files which have an edge from vertex i to j. The isomorphism between 
#the subgroups is described by sending the generators of the first half of the list
#to the generators of the second half of the list. In this example, the map from the
#subgroup assigned to the edge oriented from vertex 1 to vertex 2 to the subgroup
#assigned to the edge oriented from vertex 2 to vertex 1 is defined by mapping the
#generators c goes to a, C goes to A, etc. 
#For i=j, the entry in the ith row and ith column is the list whose first entry is 
#the rewriting system for the vertex group, then the subgroup files which have an 
#edge from vertex i to i.
